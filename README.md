## Game Show App

I created a browser version of "Wheel of Success", a work guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try and guess a random phrase. 

Using Javascript, I created an array of phrases and wrote functions to choose a random phrase from that array. The phrase then splits into letters and those letters are put onto the game board.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. They can only guess a letter once.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.
